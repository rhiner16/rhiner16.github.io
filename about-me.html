            <h1>Hi, I'm Rowan Hiner</h1>
            <p>I'm a business administration student at the Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina, with a double major in Economics and Finance and a minor in Data Science, graduating in May 2024. My academic journey and professional experiences have fostered a deep passion for financial and data analytics, where I have honed my ability to work with large datasets and apply critical analytical techniques to solve complex problems.</p>
            
            <p>During my internship at Azura Vascular / Fresenius Medical Care, I collaborated closely with Regional Operations Directors, managing and analyzing financial statements for twenty-one healthcare facilities across nine states. This role not only sharpened my analytical skills but also taught me the importance of strategic planning and efficient operations management in enhancing patient care quality.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to my professional experiences, I've dedicated significant time to personal projects, further developing my skills in programming languages such as Python, R, and Java, and exploring big data technologies like PIG and SQL. This self-driven exploration complements my academic achievements and internships, preparing me to tackle challenges in the financial and data analytics sectors.</p>
            
            <p>As I transition from academia to the professional world, I am eager to apply my analytical and technical skills to drive meaningful insights and contribute to the success of an organization. My background in computer science, coupled with a solid foundation in business analytics, positions me uniquely to bridge the gap between data science and financial analysis.</p>
            
            <p>Feel free to connect with me through <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rowan-hiner-574359220">LinkedIn</a> or via email (button below) to discuss potential opportunities, share insights, or collaborate on projects. I am always looking to expand my network and explore new challenges in the field of financial and data analytics.</p>
